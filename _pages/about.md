<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student at [School of Computing and Data Science](https://www.cds.hku.hk/), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). 

My current research interests lie in the field of **AI Agent**, and my long-term vision is to build proactive agents that can continuously work and learn in a human-like way. Also, I am expanding my interests to other fields like **Reinforcement Learning** and **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**.

I am also a **Physics enthusiast** and a former PhOer, so it really fascinates me to apply the ideas and models in Physics to AI. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested!
